# build-libs should be dependent on the type specification and the
# type compiler. Building the libs in this way means that you don't
# need to put automatically generated code in a source code version
# control repository (e.g., cvs, git). It also ensures that you always
# have the most up-to-date libs and documentation if your compile-docs
# target depends on the compiled libs.
