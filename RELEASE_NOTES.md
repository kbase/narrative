### OVERVIEW
The Narrative Interface allows users to craft KBase Narratives using a combination of GUI-based commands, Python and R scripts, and graphical output elements.

This is built on the Jupyter Notebook v4.4.1 (more notes will follow).

### Version 3.5.0
- TASK-1054 - Create a new loading window with a set of tasks to load and connect to (treats the problem of slowly loading websockets, still probably needs some adjusting).
- TASK-588 - Change status of importers from "suspend" to "error" if the import job fails.
- KBASE-3778/TASK-1017 - hide "next steps" area of app results tab if there are no next steps available.
- KBASE-1041 - fix error that shows a version number instead of username for who saved the most recent narrative.
- TASK-1069 - fix problems with searching and filtering the App panel
    - Searching by output object type works again.
    - Added "input:" and "output:" as filters for input object types and output object types (same as "in_type:" and "out_type:", respectively)
    - Made type search more stringent.
        - If no "." separator is present, will only match by the type name. E.g. "in_type:Genome" will not match "GenomeSet" or "PanGenome" or "KBaseGenomes.ContigSet", just "ANYMODULE.Genome"
        - If a "." is present, will only match a full type name, like "KBaseGenomes.Genome"
    - Non-type search will also search i/o fields now and do fuzzy matching. E.g. "Genome" will match "Annotate Domains in a GenomeSet" (by the name), and "Assemble Reads with MEGAHIT" (by the output object KBaseGenomeAnnotations.Assembly)
- TASK-1079 - fix problems with code cell rendering and controls.
- KBASE-5275 - fix title for code cells used to track import jobs.


### Version 3.4.4

    - Read-only narratives cannot have app inputs modified.
    - In read-only mode, no data view cells can be added.
    - In read-only mode, code cells are not editable.
    - In read-only mode, narrative titles can no longer be edited.
    - Removed the "config" cog button in the top menu.
    - Double-clicking markdown content switches to edit mode.
    - App cells should no longer flash their code area before converting to the widget view on narrative startup.
- TASK-1041 - when a Narrative is open in multiple locations (whether windows in the same browser with the same user, or different computers all together with different users), and is saved in one location, the other location should now get a notification that it is out of date.

- Fix Docker image so that it doesn't spam the annoying SSL errors in all cells.
- Put code area toggle on all code cells at all times. (Just to give Erik and I something to argue about)

### Version 3.0.0-alpha-1
__Major Updates__
- Apps and Methods not made as part of KBase SDK modules are now obsolete and will no longer run. Those apps have been replaced with Markdown cells that note their obsolescence, but still give the name and set of parameters used in the apps for reference. This also gives suggestions for updated apps (that will be available in production eventually...)
- The distinction between "App" and "Method" has been removed. All cells that execute KBase jobs are now referred to as Apps.
- All app cells are now based on Jupyter code cells (previously they were based on heavily modified Markdown cells). This means that they generate code that gets executed in the same way that any other code does. This also introduces a KBase Jobs API that gives programmatic access to running Apps. See docs/developer/job_api.md for details.
- All output and viewer cells are now code cells as well. Existing viewers are still based on Markdown cells, and should work as previously.
- All visualization widgets had their initialization code slightly modified. See docs/developer/narrative_widgets.md for details.

__Other Changes__
- Update Jupyter to version 4.2.1.
- Update IPython kernel to version 5.0.0.
- Adds a settings menu for editing user options (prototype).
- App cells tightly validate each input before generating runnable code - until all required inputs are valid, no code can be run.
- The Jobs panel gets its information pushed from the kernel, and that from communicating with back end servies. Job information is no longer stored in Narrative objects.
- Running Jobs are associated directly with a Narrative, and inherit its view permissions accordingly; if you can view a Narrative, you can view its running jobs.
- Copying a shared Narrative no longer copies its Jobs - copying a Narrative with running Jobs will not copy the results.
- Updated the job log widget to no longer fetch all lines of a running log. It has a limit of 100 lines at a time, with buttons to navigate around the log.

### Release 6/20/2014
__Changes__

- %%inv\_run cell magic should now work properly
- %inv\_run magic (line and cell) now translate some convenience commands
    - %inv\_run ls == %inv\_ls
    - %inv\_run cwd (or pwd) == %inv\_cwd
    - %inv\_run mkdir == %inv\_make\_directory
    - %inv\_run rmdir == %inv\_remove_directory
    - %inv\_run cd == %inv\_cd
    - %inv\_run rm == %inv\_remove\_files
    - %inv\_run mv == %inv\_rename\_files
- The menu bar should remain at the top of the page now, instead of being positioned inline with the rest of the narrative document.

__Known Issues__
- %inv\_ls to a directory that doesn't exist will create a generic, not-very-informative error.
- [NAR-153], [NAR-177] A generic "Autosave failed!" message appears when the narrative fails to save for any reason.
- [NAR-169] Using Safari through HTTPS will not work with an uncertified SSL credential (which we currently have)
- [NAR-173] If problems external to the Narrative prevent loading (authentication, Shock or WS downtime), an ugly stacktrace is dumped into the browser instead of a nicely rendered error page.
- [NAR-180] Copying narratives in the newsfeed can cause errors.
- [NAR-179] There's a problem that occurs when logged into a narrative for a long time.
