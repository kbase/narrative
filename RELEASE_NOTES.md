### OVERVIEW
The Narrative Interface allows users to craft KBase Narratives using a combination of GUI-based commands, Python and R scripts, and graphical output elements.

This is built on the IPython Notebook (more notes will follow).

- States of long running methods calling services are now shown on Job panel and Job panel waits for 'Done' state before show output widget
- Added a 'debug' viewer to the apps. After starting an app's run, click on the gear menu in the app cell and select 'View Job Submission'. This will both emit the returned kernel messages from that app run into your browser's Javascript console, and it will create and run a code cell that will show you the object that gets set to the Job Service.

- Updates to Jnomics functions and widgets
- Updates to Microbes functions and widgets
- Most errors that were dumped to the browser as ugly stacktraces are now KBase-styled stacktraces that should be slightly more legible.
- Errors that occur when Narrative saving fails now creates an error modal that communicates the error, instead of just "Autosave Failed!"
- Deployment of Narrative Docker containers has changed. A base container is built containing most static dependencies (all the apt-get directives, Python and R packages). This container is then updated with the Narrative itself. After building the base container, deployment of subsequent releases should take ~2 minutes.
- Updated workspace type registry (the kbtypes class) to be up-to-date with the current state of the Workspace.
- The Narrative should now report unsupported browsers

__Known Issues__
- Unaddressed issues from previous release

### Release 6/20/2014
__Changes__

- %%inv\_run cell magic should now work properly
- %inv\_run magic (line and cell) now translate some convenience commands
    - %inv\_run ls == %inv\_ls
    - %inv\_run cwd (or pwd) == %inv\_cwd
    - %inv\_run mkdir == %inv\_make\_directory
    - %inv\_run rmdir == %inv\_remove_directory
    - %inv\_run cd == %inv\_cd
    - %inv\_run rm == %inv\_remove\_files
    - %inv\_run mv == %inv\_rename\_files
- The menu bar should remain at the top of the page now, instead of being positioned inline with the rest of the narrative document.

__Known Issues__
- %inv\_ls to a directory that doesn't exist will create a generic, not-very-informative error.
- [NAR-153], [NAR-177] A generic "Autosave failed!" message appears when the narrative fails to save for any reason.
- [NAR-169] Using Safari through HTTPS will not work with an uncertified SSL credential (which we currently have)
- [NAR-173] If problems external to the Narrative prevent loading (authentication, Shock or WS downtime), an ugly stacktrace is dumped into the browser instead of a nicely rendered error page.
- [NAR-180] Copying narratives in the newsfeed can cause errors.
- [NAR-179] There's a problem that occurs when logged into a narrative for a long time.
