/**
 * A little wrapper script for making sure that Narrative code
 * is injected at the right time before loading the Notebook running
 * code.
 *
 * Mainly, we need to load up a configuration, then make
 * sure that the other Narrative JS widgets are loaded *first*,
 * because they're referenced from within Markdown cells at Notebook
 * load time.
 *
 * I'm not thrilled about this, but if this isn't done, then our GUI
 * method/app/output widget cells are replaced by ReferenceErrors.
 *
 * Once this step is complete, the notebook main is run, and the
 * actual KBase Narrative startup code is instantiated in custom.js,
 * where is all ought to be. This is a ***temporary*** solution,
 * until we migrate our Frankenstein'd markdown cells to proper
 * output cells.
