"""
Manage registering jobs.

This is a thin wrapper around some parts of the User and Job State service. When
it registers jobs *within the Narrative* it also shares them with the account
narrativejoblistener.

This is a cheesy way to share jobs so that all users can see what long-running
jobs are going.

Consider this a pass at alleviating some of our current August 2014 panic-mode.

UPDATED 1/28/2015
This manages where jobs get looked up, whether from the UJS or NJS or wherever
else they're running from. The 'poll_jobs' method routes the job to the service
it needs to be looked up from.
