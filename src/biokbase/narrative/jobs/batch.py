def generate_input_batch(app, tag='release', **kwargs):
    """
    This takes in an app, tag, and set of loosely-defined kwargs to build a batch of app runs.
    app is the app id, in the format "Module/method", e.g.("MEGAHIT/run_megahit")
    tag should be one of 'dev', 'beta', or 'release'

    The rest is where it gets tricky.

    kwargs is, as usual for Python, a set of keys and values. In this case, the keys are the app parameter ids
    as defined by the app spec, and the values are a range of values for each parameter.

    These sets of ranges are then shuffled together in such a way that all permutations define different
    runs of the app.

    Effectively, each value of the kwargs is expected to be a list. Parameters that are defined by
    the spec to be lists (the "allow_multiple" flag is truthy) are expected to be lists of lists.

    For example, the MEGAHIT inputs are a simple dictionary with several keys. For this example, they have
    "read_library_ref", "min_contig_len", and "output_assembly" as keys, all of which are expected to have
    a single value. So a normal set of inputs for a single run might look like this:
    {
        "read_library_ref": "1/2/1",
        "min_contig_len": 500,
        "output_assembly": "assembled_reads"
    }

    The goal in building a batch of MEGAHIT runs is to assemble multiple read libraries into their successive
    assemblies, possibly over a range of minimum contig lengths to select the best assembly. So I might have
    the following in kwargs:
    read_library_ref = ["1/2/1", "1/3/1", "1/4/1"]
    min_contig_len = [500, 1000]

    output_assembly gets tricky, since that's the output. We know it's the output from the spec as well, so
    we can know what to do with it. The options are to let this function pick a random name appended to
    the default output name of "MEGAHIT.contigs", or a list of strings (one for each run), or to create a
    template that will have either a random number appended (the run index) or some combination of values
    from the inputs. This would be a Python-based template, something like:
    "MEGAHIT.contigs_${read_library_ref}_${min_contig_len}"

    In the end, this should form a list of 6 app runs:
    [{
        "read_library_ref": "1/2/1",
        "min_contig_len": 500,
        "output_assembly": "MEGAHIT.contigs1"
    },{
        "read_library_ref": "1/2/1",
        "min_contig_len": 1000,
        "output_assembly": "MEGAHIT.contigs2"
    },{
        "read_library_ref": "1/3/1",
        "min_contig_len": 500,
        "output_assembly": "MEGAHIT.contigs3"
    },{
        "read_library_ref": "1/3/1",
        "min_contig_len": 1000,
        "output_assembly": "MEGAHIT.contigs4"
    },{
        "read_library_ref": "1/4/1",
        "min_contig_len": 500,
        "output_assembly": "MEGAHIT.contigs5"
    },{
        "read_library_ref": "1/4/1",
        "min_contig_len": 1000,
        "output_assembly": "MEGAHIT.contigs6"
    }]

    which is what gets returned.

    Any input not specified in kwargs is left as default as described in the spec, or None if there is no
    description.

    So, again, the optional values for each kwarg are:
    * a single value (applied to all runs)
    * a list of values (used to build a set of runs)
    * for numeric values, a 3-tuple - (min, interval, max) - to be used as a generator

    For output parameters (as identified by the app spec), acceptable values are:
    * a list of strings, the length of the total number of batches created. If this is off (e.g., 10
      values are given, but only 8 batches are made), then a ValueError will be raised.
    * a templated string like this: my_output_{{some_param}}
        * the template values are all parameter ids or:
        * a special template {{run_number}} is allowed, which is an integer for which run
          of the batch this is
    * nothing. If nothing, then the default output value will be used with {{run_number}} appended
      to the end. If there is no default output value, then a ValueError will be raised.

    Very little validation will be done here for the various values. Values expected by the spec to be
    numbers of some range will be checked, UPAs will be validated to be formatted correctly, and
    output object name strings will have their formatting validated (e.g. no spaces are allowed in workspace
    object names)
