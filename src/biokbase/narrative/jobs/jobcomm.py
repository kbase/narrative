class JobRequest:
    """
    A small wrapper for job comm channel request data.
    This generally comes in the form of a packet from the kernel Comm object.
    It's expected to be a dict of the format:
    {
        content: {
            'comm_id': <some string>,
            'data': {
                'request_type': effectively, the function requested.
            }
        }
    }

    This little wrapper fills 2 roles:
    1. It validates that the packet is correct and has some expected values.
    2. If there's a job_id field, it makes sure that it's real (by asking the
       JobManager - avoids a bunch of duplicate validation code)

    Provides 4 attributes:
    msg_id: str - a unique string (within reason) for a message id.
    request: str - a string for the request sent from the front end. This isn't
        strictly controlled here, but by JobComm._handle_comm_message.
    job_id: str - (optional) - a string for the job id, as set by EE2.
    rq_data: dict - the actual data of the request. Containers the request type,
        job_id (sometimes), and other information that can be specific for
        each request.

class JobComm:
    """
    The main JobComm channel. This is the kernel-side of the connection, and routes
    requests for job information from various app cells (or the front end in general)
    to the right function.

    This has a handle on the JobManager, which does the work of fetching job information
    and statuses.

    The JobComm officially exposes the channel for other things to use. Anything that
    needs to send messages about Jobs to the front end should use JobComm.send_comm_message.

    It also maintains the lookup loop thread. This is a threading.Timer that, after
    some interval, will lookup the status of all running jobs. If there are no jobs to
    look up, this cancels itself.

    Allowed messages:
    * all_status - return job state for all jobs in this Narrative.
    * job_status - return the job state for a single job (requires a job_id)
    * job_info - return basic job info for a single job (requires a job_id)
    * start_update_loop - starts a looping thread that runs returns all job info
        for running jobs
    * stop_update_loop - stops the automatic update loop
    * start_job_update - tells the update loop to include a job when updating (requires a job_id)
    * stop_job_update - has the update loop not include a job when updating (requires a job_id)
    * cancel_job - cancels a running job, if it hasn't otherwise terminated (requires a job_id)
    * job_logs - sends job logs back over the comm channel (requires a job id and first line)
    * job_logs_latest - sends the most recent job logs over the comm channel (requires a job_id)
