           FOLLOWING: Reference following guarantees that a user that has
           access to an object can always see a) objects that are referenced
           inside the object and b) objects that are referenced in the
           object's provenance. This ensures that the user has visibility
           into the entire provenance of the object and the object's object
           dependencies (e.g. references). The user must have at least read
           access to the object specified in this SO, but need not have
           access to any further objects in the reference chain, and those
           objects may be deleted. Optional reference following fields:
           ref_chain obj_path - a path to the desired object from the object
           specified in this OS. In other words, the object specified in this
           OS is assumed to be accessible to the user, and the objects in the
           object path represent a chain of references to the desired object
           at the end of the object path. If the references are all valid,
           the desired object will be returned. - OR - list<obj_ref>
           obj_ref_path - shorthand for the obj_path. Only one of obj_path or
           obj_ref_path may be specified. OBJECT SUBSETS: When selecting a
           subset of an array in an object, the returned array is compressed
           to the size of the subset, but the ordering of the array is
           maintained. For example, if the array stored at the 'feature' key
           of a Genome object has 4000 entries, and the object paths provided
           are: /feature/7 /feature/3015 /feature/700 The returned feature

           order, of the 7th, 700th, and 3015th entries of the original
           array. Optional object subset fields: list<object_path> included -
           the portions of the object to include in the object subset.
           boolean strict_maps - if true, throw an exception if the subset
           specification traverses a non-existant map key (default false)
