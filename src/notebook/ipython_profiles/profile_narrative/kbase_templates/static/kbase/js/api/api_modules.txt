This is a list of the available clients in kbase-client-api.min.js, and how they're invoked.
E.g., to make a workspace client, you do:

var client = new Workspace(<params>);
...etc.

They're all generated by the type compiler except for
AweClient and ShockClient, so you'll have to deal with those separately.
